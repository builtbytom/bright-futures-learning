  "story": "When Maria first came to Bright Futures Learning Center, she was a shy second-grader who struggled to read even simple sentences. Her teacher had recommended extra support, and her mother, working two jobs, didn't know how to help.\n\n\"I remember Maria hiding behind her mom during the first session,\" recalls volunteer tutor Sarah Chen. \"She was so afraid of making mistakes that she barely spoke above a whisper.\"\n\nThrough patient, one-on-one tutoring in our Reading Champions program, Maria began to make connections between letters and sounds. Her tutor used Maria's love of animals to engage her, starting with picture books about puppies and kittens.\n\nThe breakthrough came after three months when Maria read an entire book by herself - 'Clifford the Big Red Dog.' \"She was so proud, she insisted on reading it again to everyone in the center,\" Sarah remembers.\n\nToday, Maria is a confident fourth-grader on the honor roll. She's read over 100 books and even helps younger students in our Early Readers Circle. \"Sometimes kids need someone to believe in them,\" says Maria's mother, Teresa. \"Bright Futures gave us that and so much more.\"",
