  "story": "Jayden arrived at Bright Futures as a quiet 12-year-old who loved reading but struggled to connect with peers. His grandmother, who was raising him, noticed he spent hours writing in notebooks but never showed anyone his work.\n\n\"I knew he had something special inside,\" his grandmother Patricia says. \"He just needed the right environment to let it out.\"\n\nIn the Teen Book Club, Jayden discovered poets like Langston Hughes and Amanda Gorman. During a workshop on poetry, volunteer facilitator Marcus Williams noticed Jayden's natural talent for rhythm and metaphor.\n\n\"His first poem about feeling invisible in a crowded room - it gave me chills,\" Marcus recalls. \"I knew we had to nurture this gift.\"\n\nWith encouragement from the group, Jayden began sharing his poetry. His pieces about identity, belonging, and hope resonated with other teens. When we published our annual anthology, Jayden's poem 'Invisible No More' was selected as the featured piece.\n\nThe transformation was remarkable. Jayden went from a boy who barely spoke to performing his poetry at our community showcase. He's since won a citywide poetry competition and mentors younger students in finding their creative voices.\n\n\"Bright Futures showed me that my words matter,\" Jayden says. \"They taught me that being different isn't something to hide - it's my superpower.\"",
