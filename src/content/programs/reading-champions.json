Through one-on-one tutoring and small group sessions, we help students overcome reading challenges and build confidence.\n\nOur evidence-based curriculum focuses on phonics, fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension. Each child receives a personalized learning plan based on their specific needs and learning style. We use engaging, culturally relevant books and interactive technology to make learning exciting.\n\nThe program includes regular progress assessments, parent communication, and coordination with school teachers to ensure consistent support. Students who complete the program typically gain 1.5 years of reading ability in just 6 months!",
