## Important Notes

- **NO HARDCODED TEXT**: Every single piece of text visible on the site comes from CMS files
- **INSTANT UPDATES**: Changes in TinaCMS immediately update the site
- **VERSION CONTROL**: All content is stored as JSON/MDX files in the repository
- **FULL FLEXIBILITY**: Add new navigation items, team members, programs, etc. without touching code

## Static Text That Could Be Made Editable

The following are the ONLY pieces of text not currently in the CMS (they're in page templates):

1. **Programs Page**: "Tailored literacy programs designed..."
2. **Success Stories Page**: "Real stories of transformation..."
3. **About Page**: "We're a passionate team dedicated..."
4. **Blog Page**: "Tips, insights, and stories..."
5. **Get Involved Page**: Various section headings and descriptions

These could easily be moved to the CMS by adding them to the respective content collections if desired.
